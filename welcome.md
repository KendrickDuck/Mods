Hi and welcome to the KendrickDuck server. In order to play in the server a few configurations are required. Please follow the steps down below to get ready for the magic of KendrickDuck!!


## 1. Download and Install Forge
The first thing is to download Forge 1.20.1 (47.2.20). The installer can be found [here](forge/forge-1.20.1-47.2.20-installer.jar). Download and install into your computer.

Create a blank folder in your computer and name it. This will be the directory of your Forge installment.

Once you have Forge installed, open the minecraft launcher. Click on [Installations](welcome.md), then [New Installation](welcome.md). Under [Version](welcome.md), select [release 1.20.1-forge-47.2.20](welcome.md) (You might have to scroll or type to find it).
