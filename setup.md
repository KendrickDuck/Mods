# KendrickDuck Setup Guide

Hi and welcome to the KendrickDuck server. In order to play in the server a few setups are required. Please follow the steps down below to get ready for the magic of KendrickDuck!!


## 1. Download, Install, and Configure Forge
The first thing is to download Forge 1.20.1 (47.2.20). The installer can be found [here](forge/forge-1.20.1-47.2.20-installer.jar). Download and install into your computer.

Create a blank folder in your computer and name it. This will be the directory of your Forge installment.

Once you have Forge installed and created your directory, open the minecraft launcher. 

Click on [Installations](#), then [New Installation](#). Under [Version](#), select [release 1.20.1-forge-47.2.20](#) (You might have to scroll or type to find it). Under [Game Directory](#), click [Browse](#) next to the search bar and select the empty folder you have just created.

Click [Create](#) once you have everything set up.

You should be able to find your newly created installation at the very bottom. Hover onto the installation and click [Play](#). The game should launch once you've clicked on it.

Once the game is done launching and you're at the main menu, leave the game by clicking [Quit Game](#) on the main menu.

## 2. Download and install mods

Go to [mods](mods) and download the mods contained in the folder. Alternatively, you can download the [zip](mods.zip) file which contains all the mods.

Once you have downloaded all the mods, open your game directory (You can do this through minecraft launcher by clicking the folder icon next to [Play](#). Select the [mods](#) folder in your directory, and drag all the mods you have just downloaded into the folder.

Now go back to the launcher and launch the game.

## 3. Connect to Server

Once you have launched the game, click on [Multiplayer](#) under the main menu, click on [Add Server](#). Under [Server Address](#), type the server domain and click [Done](#).

**Server Domain:** Kendrickduck.aternos.me:9898

You're all set! Connect and enjoy! :))
